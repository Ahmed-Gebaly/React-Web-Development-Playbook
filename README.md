# DEPI React Web Development Track ⚛️🚀

Welcome to my **DEPI React Web Development Track** repository!

This repository showcases my learning journey and hands-on experience throughout the DEPI program. It highlights a strong foundation in web development fundamentals, including **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with a specialization in building **React applications**.

Beyond the frontend, this work reflects proficiency in **Git and GitHub** for version control, experience with **Node.js** for server-side development, and a working understanding of **containerization technologies** such as **Docker and Kubernetes**.  

All of these skills come together in a **capstone project** that integrates **React and Node.js** to deliver a real-world web application.
